//Inside the menu object, we are going to create a method called .addDishToCourse() which will be used to add a new dish to the specified course on the menu.

//The method should take in three parameters: the courseName, the dishName , and the dishPrice.

//The .addDishToCourse() method should create an object called dish which has a name and price which it gets from the parameters.

//The method should then push this dish object into the appropriate array in your menu‘s _courses object based on what courseName was passed in.

    addDishToCourse (courseName, dishName, dishPrice) {

//Now, we’re going to need another function which will allow us to get a random dish from a course on the menu, which will be necessary for generating a random meal.

//Create a method inside the menu object called .getRandomDishFromCourse(). It will take in one parameter which is the courseName.

// There are a few steps in getting the .getRandomDishFromCourse() to work.

// Retrieve the array of the given course’s dishes from the menu‘s _courses object and store in a variable called dishes.
// Generate a random index by multiplying Math.random() by the length of the dishes array (This will guarantee that the random number will be between 0 and the length of the array)
// Round that generated number to a whole number by using Math.floor() on the result.
// Return the dish located at that index in dishes.

      const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random()*dishes.length);

    },


// Now that we have a way to get a random dish from a course, we can create a .generateRandomMeal() function which will automatically generate a three-course meal for us. The function doesn’t need to take any parameters.

// The function should create an appetizer variable which should be the result of calling the .getRandomDishFromCourse() method when we pass in an appetizers string to it.
// Create a main variable and dessert variable the same way you created the appetizer variable, but make sure to pass in the right course type.
// Calculates the total price and returns a string that contains the name of each of the dishes and the total price of the meal, formatted as you like.


    generateRandomMeal: function() {

        return `Your meal is ${appetizer.name}, ${main.name}, ${dessert.name}. The price is ${totalPrice}.`;
    },
  };


//   Now that we’ve finished our menu, object, let’s use it to create a menu by adding some appetizers, mains, and desserts with the .addDishToCourse() function. Add at least 3 dishes to each course (or more if you like!).

  menu.addDishToCourse('appetizers','pasta', 10);

  menu.addDishToCourse('appetizers','pasta', 9.20);

  menu.addDishToCourse('mains','fish', 18.50);
  menu.addDishToCourse('mains','lamb', 15.00);
  
  menu.addDishToCourse('desserts','icecream', 3.00);
  menu.addDishToCourse('desserts','cake', 3.50);
  menu.addDishToCourse('desserts','coffee', 1.50);
  

//   Once your menu has items inside it, generate a meal by using the .generateRandomMeal() function on your menu, and save it to a variable called meal. Lastly, print out your meal variable to see what meal was generated for you.
